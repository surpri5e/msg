               Hi Ced! I know kailangan lang tayo naging close like after ds? I mean we had a small interaction back then, but I can say that we are more closer now than before. Not that close, but I don't know how this thing happen that I find myself developing a feelings for you.
              <br />
              <br />
              At first, I didn't expect this. I was even shipping you with Ella! But somehow, my feelings changed. I catch myself looking forward to seeing you daily and can't help but notice everything you do. 
              <br />
              <br />
              This might sound strange, but I genuinely like you, Ced. Your presence draws me in, making me feel happy and comfortable. 
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm willing to accept whatever response you may have, even rejection. I hope that my admiration for you won't change our friendship, regardless of your decision. Your circle of friends brings joy, and I cherish our bond. Thank you, Nemisan, for inspiring me. I'll cherish my feelings, even from afar. Please keep this private, I might get embarrassed if our friends found out! üò≠ü§çüå∑
